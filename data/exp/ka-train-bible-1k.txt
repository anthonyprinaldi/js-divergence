You are in the right, O Lord, when I put my cause before you: still let me take up with you the question of your decisions: why does the evil-doer do well? why are the workers of deceit living in comfort?
They have been planted by you, they have taken root; they go on and give fruit: you are near in their mouths but far from their thoughts.
But you, O Lord, have knowledge of me; you see me, searching and testing how my heart is with you: let them be pulled out like sheep to be put to death, make them ready for the day of death.
How long will the land have grief, and the plants of all the land be dry? because of the sins of the people living in it, destruction has overtaken the beasts and the birds; because they said, God does not see our ways.
If running with the fighting-men has made you tired, how will you be able to keep up with horses? and if in a land of peace you go in flight, what will become of you in the thick growth of Jordan?
For even your brothers, your father's family, even they have been untrue to you, crying loudly after you: have no faith in them, though they say fair words to you.
I have given up my house, I have let my heritage go; I have given the loved one of my soul into the hands of her haters.
My heritage has become like a lion in the woodland to me; her voice has been loud against me; so I have hate for her.
My heritage is like a brightly coloured bird to me; the cruel birds are attacking her on every side: go, get together all the beasts of the field, make them come for destruction.
The keepers of sheep have been the destruction of my vine-garden, crushing my heritage under their feet; they have made my fair heritage an unplanted waste;
They have made it waste; it is weeping to me, being wasted; all the land is made waste, because no man takes it to heart.
Those who make waste have come on all the open hilltops in the waste land; for the sword of the Lord sends destruction from one end of the land to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.
Though good grain was planted, they have got in thorns: they have given themselves pain without profit: they will be shamed on account of their produce, because of the burning wrath of the Lord.
This is what the Lord has said against all my evil neighbours, who put their hands on the heritage which I gave my people Israel: See, I will have them uprooted from their land, uprooting the people of Judah from among them.
And it will come about that, after they have been uprooted, I will again have pity on them; and I will take them back, every man to his heritage and every man to his land.
And it will be that, if they give their minds to learning the ways of my people, using my name in their oaths, By the living Lord; as they have been teaching my people to take oaths by the Baal; then their place will be made certain among my people.
But if they will not give ear, then I will have that nation uprooted, and given to destruction, says the Lord.
At last our desire to have news of you was so strong that, while we ourselves were waiting at Athens,
We sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ, to give you strength and comfort in your faith;
So that no man might be moved by these troubles; because you see that these things are part of God's purpose for us.
And when we were with you, we said to you that trouble was before us; and so it came about, as you see.
For this reason, when I was no longer able to keep quiet, I sent to get news of your faith, fearing that you might be tested by the Evil One and that our work might come to nothing.
But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has given us good news of your faith and love, and that you have happy memories of us, desiring greatly to see us, even as we do to see you;
For this cause, brothers, in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith;
For it is life to us if you keep your faith in the Lord unchanged.
For how great is the praise which we give to God for you, and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our God;
Night and day requesting God again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete.
Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus make a way for us to come to you;
And the Lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men, even as our love to you;
So that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
So then, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.
And the things which I have said to you before a number of witnesses, give to those of the faith, so that they may be teachers of others.
Be ready to do without the comforts of life, as one of the army of Christ Jesus.
A fighting man, when he is with the army, keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army.
And if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules.
It is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit.
Give thought to what I say; for the Lord will give you wisdom in all things.
Keep in mind Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, who came back from the dead, as my good news gives witness:
In which I put up with the hardest conditions, even prison chains, like one who has done a crime; but the word of God is not in chains.
But I undergo all things for the saints, so that they may have salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
This is a true saying: If we undergo death with him, then will we be living with him:
If we go on to the end, then we will be ruling with him: if we say we have no knowledge of him, then he will say he has no knowledge of us:
If we are without faith, still he keeps faith, for he will never be untrue to himself.
Put these things before them, giving them orders in the name of the Lord to keep themselves from fighting about words, which is of no profit, only causing error in their hearers.
Let it be your care to get the approval of God, as a workman who has no cause for shame, giving the true word in the right way.
But take no part in wrong and foolish talk, for those who do so will go farther into evil,
And their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh: such are Hymenaeus and Philetus;
Men whose ideas are all false, who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place, overturning the faith of some.
But God's strong base is unchanging, having this sign, The Lord has knowledge of those who are his: and, Let everyone by whom the name of the Lord is named be turned away from evil.
Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but others of wood and earth, and some which are honoured and some without honour.
If a man makes himself clean from these, he will be a vessel for honour, made holy, ready for the master's use, ready for every good work.
But keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young, and go after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those whose prayers go up to the Lord from a clean heart.
And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings, seeing that they are a cause of trouble.
For it is not right for the Lord's servant to make trouble, but he is to be gentle to all, ready in teaching, putting up with wrong,
Gently guiding those who go against the teaching; if by chance God may give them a change of heart and true knowledge,
And so they may get themselves free from the net of the Evil One, being made the prisoners of the Lord's servant, for the purpose of God.
Give ear to me, you who are searching for righteousness, who are looking for the Lord: see the rock from which you were cut out, and the hole out of which you were taken.
Let your thoughts be turned to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth: for when he was but one, my voice came to him, and I gave him my blessing, and made him a great people.
For the Lord has given comfort to Zion: he has made glad all her broken walls; making her waste places like Eden, and changing her dry land into the garden of the Lord; joy and delight will be there, praise and the sound of melody.
Give attention to me, O my people; and give ear to me, O my nation; for teaching will go out from me, and the knowledge of the true God will be a light to the peoples.
Suddenly will my righteousness come near, and my salvation will be shining out like the light; the sea-lands will be waiting for me, and they will put their hope in my strong arm.
Let your eyes be lifted up to the heavens, and turned to the earth which is under them: for the heavens will go in flight like smoke, and the earth will become old like a coat, and its people will come to destruction like insects: but my salvation will be for ever, and my righteousness will not come to an end.
Give ear to me, you who have knowledge of righteousness, in whose heart is my law; have no fear of the evil words of men, and give no thought to their curses.
For like a coat they will be food for the insect, the worm will make a meal of them like wool: but my righteousness will be for ever, and my salvation to all generations.
Awake! awake! put on strength, O arm of the Lord, awake! as in the old days, in the generations long past. Was it not by you that Rahab was cut in two, and the dragon Wounded?
Did you not make the sea dry, the waters of the great deep? did you not make the deep waters of the sea a way for the Lord's people to go through?
Those whom the Lord has made free will come back with songs to Zion; and on their heads will be eternal joy: delight and joy will be theirs, and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever.
I, even I, am your comforter: are you so poor in heart as to be in fear of man who will come to an end, and of the son of man who will be like grass?
And you have given no thought to the Lord your Maker, by whom the heavens were stretched out, and the earth placed on its base; and you went all day in fear of the wrath of the cruel one, when he was making ready for your destruction. And where is the wrath of the cruel one?
The prisoner, bent under his chain, will quickly be made free, and will not go down into the underworld, and his bread will not come to an end.
For I am the Lord your God, who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering: the Lord of armies is his name.
And I have put my words in your mouth, covering you with the shade of my hand, stretching out the heavens, and placing the earth on its base, and saying to Zion, You are my people.
Awake! awake! up! O Jerusalem, you who have taken from the Lord's hand the cup of his wrath; tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes.
She has no one among all her children to be her guide; not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand.
These two things have come on you; who will be weeping for you? wasting and destruction; death from need of food, and from the sword; how may you be comforted?
Your sons are overcome, like a roe in a net; they are full of the wrath of the Lord, the punishment of your God.
So now give ear to this, you who are troubled and overcome, but not with wine:
This is the word of the Lord your master, even your God who takes up the cause of his people: See, I have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes, even the cup of my wrath; it will not again be given to you:
And I will put it into the hand of your cruel masters, and of those whose yoke has been hard on you; who have said to your soul, Down on your face! so that we may go over you: and you have given your backs like the earth, even like the street, for them to go over.
O come, let us make songs to the Lord; sending up glad voices to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before his face with praises; and make melody with holy songs.
For the Lord is a great God, and a great King over all gods.
The deep places of the earth are in his hand; and the tops of the mountains are his.
The sea is his, and he made it; and the dry land was formed by his hands.
O come, let us give worship, falling down on our knees before the Lord our Maker.
For he is our God; and we are the people to whom he gives food, and the sheep of his flock. Today, if you would only give ear to his voice!
Let not your hearts be hard, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the waste land;
When your fathers put me to the test and saw my power and my work.
For forty years I was angry with this generation, and said, They are a people whose hearts are turned away from me, for they have no knowledge of my ways;
And I made an oath in my wrath, that they might not come into my place of rest.
Now after this, David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go up into any of the towns of Judah? And the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Where am I to go? And he said, To Hebron.
So David went there, taking with him his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
And David took all his men with him, every man with his family: and they were living in the towns round Hebron.
And the men of Judah came there, and with the holy oil made David king over the people of Judah. And word came to David that it was the men of Jabesh-gilead who put Saul's body in its last resting-place.
And David sent to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, May the Lord give you his blessing, because you have done this kind act to Saul your lord, and have put his body to rest!
May the Lord be good and true to you: and I myself will see that your kind act is rewarded, because you have done this thing.
Then let your hands be strong, and have no fear: though Saul your lord is dead, the people of Judah have made me their king.
Now Abner, the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth over to Mahanaim,
And made him king over Gilead and the Asherites and over Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin, that is, over all Israel.
(Saul's son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was ruler for two years.) But Judah was on the side of David.
And the time when David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah was seven years and six months.
And Abner, the son of Ner, with the servants of Saul's son Ish-bosheth, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and came face to face with them by the pool of Gibeon; and they took up their position, facing one another on opposite sides of the pool.
And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men give a test of their strength before us. And Joab said, Let them do so.
So they got up and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and twelve of the servants of David.
And every one got the other by the head, driving his sword into the other's side, so they all went down together: and that place was named the Field of Sides, and it is in Gibeon.
And there was hard fighting that day; and Abner and the men of Israel gave way before the servants of David.
There were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel: and Asahel was as quick-footed as a roe of the fields.
Asahel went running after Abner, not turning to the right or to the left.
Then Abner, looking back, said, Is it you, Asahel? And he said, It is I.
And Abner said, Then go to the right or to the left and put your hands on one of the fighting-men and take his arms. But Asahel would not be turned away from going after Abner.
Then again Abner said to Asahel, Go to one side, do not keep on coming after me: why will you make me put an end to you? for then I will be shamed before your brother Joab.
But still he did not go to one side: so Abner gave him a back blow in the stomach with his spear, so that the spear came out at his back; and he went down on the earth, wounded to death: and all those who came to the place where Asahel went down dead, came to a stop.
But Joab and Abishai went after Abner: and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of the road through the waste land of Geba.
And the men of Benjamin came together after Abner in one band, and took their places on the top of a hill.
Then crying out to Joab, Abner said, Are fighting and destruction to go on for ever? do you not see that the end will only be bitter? how long will it be before you send the people back and make them give up attacking their countrymen?
And Joab said, By the living God, if you had not given the word, the people would have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning.
So Joab had a horn sounded, and all the people came to a stop, and gave up going after Israel and fighting them.
And all that night Abner and his men went through the Arabah; they went over Jordan and through all Bithron and came to Mahanaim.
And Joab came back from fighting Abner: and when he had got all his men together, it was seen that nineteen of David's men, in addition to Asahel, were not with them.
But David's men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin and of Abner's men
And they took Asahel's body and put it in the last resting-place of his father in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men, travelling all night, came to Hebron at dawn.
Now Moses was looking after the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he took the flock to the back of the waste land and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
And the angel of the Lord was seen by him in a flame of fire coming out of a thorn-tree: and he saw that the tree was on fire, but it was not burned up.
And Moses said, I will go and see this strange thing, why the tree is not burned up,
And when the Lord saw him turning to one side to see, God said his name out of the tree, crying, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
And he said, Do not come near: take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy.
And he said, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses kept his face covered for fear of looking on God.
And God said, Truly, I have seen the grief of my people in Egypt, and their cry because of their cruel masters has come to my ears; for I have knowledge of their sorrows;
And I have come down to take them out of the hands of the Egyptians, guiding them out of that land into a good land and wide, into a land flowing with milk and honey; into the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
For now, truly, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the cruel behaviour of the Egyptians to them.
Come, then, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may take my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.
And Moses said to God, Who am I to go to Pharaoh and take the children of Israel out of Egypt?
And he said, Truly I will be with you; and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you have taken the children of Israel out of Egypt, you will give worship to God on this mountain.
And Moses said to God, When I come to the children of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you: and they say to me, What is his name? what am I to say to them?
And God said to him, I AM WHAT I AM: and he said, Say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.
And God went on to say to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my sign to all generations.
Go and get together the chiefs of the children of Israel, and say to them, The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has been seen by me, and has said, Truly I have taken up your cause, because of what is done to you in Egypt;
And I have said, I will take you up out of the sorrows of Egypt into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, into a land flowing with milk and honey.
And they will give ear to your voice: and you, with the chiefs of Israel, will go to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and say to him, The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has come to us: let us then go three days' journey into the waste land to make an offering to the Lord our God.
And I am certain that the king of Egypt will not let you go without being forced.
But I will put out my hand and overcome Egypt with all the wonders which I will do among them: and after that he will let you go.
And I will give this people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that when you go out you will go out with your hands full.
For every woman will get from her neighbour and from the woman living in her house, ornaments of silver and gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and your daughters; you will take the best of their goods from the Egyptians.
Say to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
Take up the cause against your mother, take it up, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; let her put away her loose ways from her face, and her false ways from between her breasts;
For fear that I may take away her robe from her, making her uncovered as in the day of her birth; making her like a waste place and a dry land, causing her death through need of water.
And I will have no mercy on her children, for they are the children of her loose ways.
For their mother has been untrue; she who gave them birth has done things of shame, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my wine.
For this cause I will put thorns in her road, building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way.
And if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them; if she makes search for them she will not see them; then will she say, I will go back to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now.
For she had no knowledge that it was I who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil, increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the Baal.
So I will take away again my grain in its time and my wine, and I will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered.
And now I will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers, and no one will take her out of my hand.
And I will put an end to all her joy, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her regular meetings.
And I will make waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are the payments which my lovers have made to me; and I will make them a waste of trees, and the beasts of the field will take them for food.
And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals, to whom she has been burning perfumes, when she made herself fair with her nose-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, giving no thought to me, says the Lord.
For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her.
And I will give her vine-gardens from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young, and as in the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
And in that day, says the Lord, you will say to me, Ishi; and you will never again give me the name of Baali;
For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and never again will she say their names.
And in that day I will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth; I will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land, and will make them take their rest in peace.
And I will take you as my bride for ever; truly, I will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging, in love and in mercies.
I will take you as my bride in good faith, and you will have knowledge of the Lord.
And it will be, in that day, says the Lord, that I will give an answer to the heavens, and the heavens to the earth;
And the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil, and they will give an answer to Jezreel;
And I will put her as seed in the earth, and I will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people, and they will say, My God.
Now it came to the ears of Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief in authority in the house of the Lord, that Jeremiah was saying these things;
And Pashhur gave blows to Jeremiah and had his feet chained in a framework of wood in the higher doorway of Benjamin, which was in the house of the Lord.
Then on the day after, Pashhur let Jeremiah loose. Then Jeremiah said to him, The Lord has given you the name of Magor-missabib (Cause-of-fear-on-every-side), not Pashhur.
For the Lord has said, See, I will make you a cause of fear to yourself and to all your friends: they will come to their death by the sword of their haters, and your eyes will see it: and I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will take them away prisoners into Babylon and put them to the sword.
And more than this, I will give all the wealth of this town and all its profits and all its things of value, even all the stores of the kings of Judah will I give into the hands of their haters, who will put violent hands on them and take them away to Babylon.
And you, Pashhur, and all who are in your house, will go away prisoners: you will come to Babylon, and there your body will be put to rest, you and all your friends, to whom you said false words.
O Lord, you have been false to me, and I was tricked; you are stronger than I, and have overcome me: I have become a thing to be laughed at all the day, everyone makes sport of me.
For every word I say is a cry for help; I say with a loud voice, Violent behaviour and wasting: because the word of the Lord is made a shame to me and a cause of laughing all the day.
And if I say, I will not keep him in mind, I will not say another word in his name; then it is in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am tired of keeping myself in, I am not able to do it.
For numbers of them say evil secretly in my hearing (there is fear on every side): they say, Come, let us give witness against him; all my nearest friends, who are watching for my fall, say, It may be that he will be taken by deceit, and we will get the better of him and give him punishment.
But the Lord is with me as a great one, greatly to be feared: so my attackers will have a fall, and they will not overcome me: they will be greatly shamed, because they have not done wisely, even with an unending shame, kept in memory for ever.
But, O Lord of armies, testing the upright and seeing the thoughts and the heart, let me see your punishment come on them; for I have put my cause before you.
Make melody to the Lord, give praise to the Lord: for he has made the soul of the poor man free from the hands of the evil-doers.
A curse on the day of my birth: let there be no blessing on the day when my mother had me.
A curse on the man who gave the news to my father, saying, You have a male child; making him very glad.
May that man be like the towns overturned by the Lord without mercy: let a cry for help come to his ears in the morning, and the sound of war in the middle of the day;
Because he did not put me to death before my birth took place: so my mother's body would have been my last resting-place, and she would have been with child for ever.
Why did I come from my mother's body to see pain and sorrow, so that my days might be wasted with shame?
And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons, and said, Be fertile, and have increase, and make the earth full.
And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands.
Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things.
But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food.
And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man.
Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image.
And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number.
And God said to Noah and to his sons,
Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you,
And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you.
And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction.
And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations:
I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth.
And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud,
And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh.
And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth.
And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth.
And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.
These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled.
In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden.
And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent.
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside.
And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed.
And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said,
Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers.
And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant.
May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.
And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;
all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.
Now when Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the king's house, and all Solomon's desires, which he had in mind were effected;
The Lord came to him again in a vision, as he had done at Gibeon;
And the Lord said to him, Your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears: I have made holy this house which you have made, and I have put my name there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there at all times.
As for you, if you will go on your way before me, as David your father did, uprightly and with a true heart, doing what I have given you orders to do, keeping my laws and my decisions;
Then I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain for ever, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be king in Israel.
But if you are turned from my ways, you or your children, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship:
Then I will have Israel cut off from the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for myself, I will put away from before my eyes; and Israel will be a public example, and a word of shame among all peoples.
And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds; and they will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house?
And their answer will be, Because they were turned away from the Lord their God, who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt; they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants: that is why the Lord has sent all this evil on them.
Now at the end of twenty years, in which time Solomon had put up the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king's house,
(Hiram, king of Tyre, had given Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees and gold, as much as he had need of,) King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee.
But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns which Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
And he said, What sort of towns are these which you have given me, my brother? So they were named the land of Cabul, to this day.
And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
Now, this was the way of Solomon's system of forced work for the building of the Lord's house and of the king's house, and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Megiddo and Gezer. ...
Pharaoh, king of Egypt, came and took Gezer, burning it down and putting to death the Canaanites living in the town, and he gave it for a bride-offering to his daughter, Solomon's wife. ...
... and Solomon was the builder of Gezer and Beth-horon the lower,
And Baalath and Tamar in the waste land, in that land;
And all the store-towns and the towns which Solomon had for his war-carriages and for his horsemen, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule.
As for the rest of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not children of Israel;
Their children who were still in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not been able to put to complete destruction, them did Solomon put to forced work, to this day.
But Solomon did not put the children of Israel to forced work; they were the men of war, his servants, his captains, and his chiefs, captains of his war-carriages and of his horsemen.
These were the chiefs of the overseers of Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, in authority over the people who did the work.
At that time Solomon made Pharaoh's daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her: then he made the Millo.
Three times in the year it was Solomon's way to give burned offerings and peace-offerings on the altar he had made to the Lord, causing his fire-offering to go up on the altar before the Lord.
And King Solomon made a sea-force of ships in Ezion-geber, by Eloth, on the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
Hiram sent his servants, who were experienced seamen, in the sea-force with Solomon's men.
And they came to Ophir, where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and took it back to King Solomon.
At the end of every seven years there is to be a general forgiveness of debt.
This is how it is to be done: every creditor is to give up his right to whatever he has let his neighbour have; he is not to make his neighbour, his countryman, give it back; because a general forgiveness has been ordered by the Lord.
A man of another nation may be forced to make payment of his debt, but if your brother has anything of yours, let it go;
But there will be no poor among you; for the Lord will certainly give you his blessing in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage;
If only you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and take care to keep all these orders which I give you today.
For the Lord your God will give you his blessing as he has said: you will let other nations have the use of your money, but you will not make use of theirs; you will be rulers over a number of nations, but they will not be your rulers.
If in any of your towns in the land which the Lord your God is giving you, there is a poor man, one of your countrymen, do not let your heart be hard or your hand shut to him;
But let your hand be open to give him the use of whatever he is in need of.
And see that there is no evil thought in your heart, moving you to say to yourself, The seventh year, the year of forgiveness is near; and so looking coldly on your poor countryman you give him nothing; and he will make an outcry to the Lord against you, and it will be judged as sin in you.
But it is right for you to give to him, without grief of heart: for because of this, the blessing of the Lord your God will be on all your work and on everything to which you put your hand.
For there will never be a time when there are no poor in the land; and so I give orders to you, Let your hand be open to your countrymen, to those who are poor and in need in your land.
If one of your countrymen, a Hebrew man or woman, becomes your servant for a price and does work for you six years, in the seventh year let him go free.
And when you make him free, do not let him go away with nothing in his hands:
But give him freely from your flock and from your grain and your wine: in the measure of the wealth which the Lord your God has given you, you are to give to him.
And keep in mind that you yourself were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God made you free: so I give you this order today.
But if he says to you, I have no desire to go away from you; because you and your family are dear to him and he is happy with you;
Then take a sharp-pointed instrument, driving it through his ear into the door, and he will be your servant for ever. And you may do the same for your servant-girl.
Let it not seem hard to you that you have to send him away free; for he has been working for you for six years, which is twice the regular time for a servant: and the blessing of the Lord your God will be on you in everything you do.
All the first males to come to birth in your herd and your flock are to be holy to the Lord your God: the first birth of your ox is not to be used for work, the wool of your first lamb is not to be cut.
But year by year you and all your house are to take a meal of it before the Lord, in the place of his selection.
But if it has any mark on it, if it is blind or has damaged legs, or if there is anything wrong with it, it may not be offered to the Lord your God.
It may be used for food in your houses: the unclean and the clean may take of it, as of the gazelle and the roe.
Only do not take its blood for food, but let it be drained out on the earth like water.
And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,
Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind?
Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value?
Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry.
For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself.
It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you.
Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills?
Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself?
What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours?
With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father.
Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you?
Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up;
So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth?
What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright?
Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes;
How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water!
Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen:
(The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us;
For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:)
The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small.
A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him:
He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword;
He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him:
He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him:
Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all,
Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight,
Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick;
And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls.
He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth.
He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud.
Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward.
His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green.
He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers.
For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire.
Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.
Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was increasing, protests were made by the Greek Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were not taken care of in the distribution of food every day.
And the Apostles sent for all the disciples and said, It is not right for us to give up preaching the word of God in order to make distribution of food.
Take then from among you seven men of good name, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, to whom we may give control of this business.
Then we will give all our time to prayer and the teaching of the word.
And this saying was pleasing to all of them: and they made selection of Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas of Antioch, who had become a Jew:
These they took to the Apostles, who, after prayer, put their hands on them.
And the word of God was increasing in power; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem became very great, and a great number of priests were in agreement with the faith.
And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
But some of those who were of the Synagogue named that of the Libertines, and some of the men of Cyrene and of Alexandria and those from Cilicia and Asia, had arguments with Stephen.
But they were not able to get the better of him, for his words were full of wisdom and of the Spirit.
Then they got men to say, He has said evil against Moses and against God, in our hearing.
And the people, with the rulers and the scribes, were moved against him, and they came and took him before the Sanhedrin,
And they got false witnesses who said, This man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law:
For he has said in our hearing that this Jesus of Nazareth will put this place to destruction and make changes in the rules which were handed down to us by Moses.
And all those who were in the Sanhedrin, looking at him, saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and, moving on from Shittim, he and all the children of Israel came to Jordan and were there for the night before going over.
And at the end of three days, the men in authority over the people went through the tents,
Giving the people their orders, and saying, When you see the ark of the agreement of the Lord your God lifted up by the priests, the Levites, then get up from your places and go after it;
But let there be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits: come no nearer to it, so that you may see the way you have to go, for you have not been over this way before.
And Joshua said to the people, Make yourselves holy, for tomorrow the Lord will do works of wonder among you.
Then Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the agreement and go over in front of the people. So they took up the ark of the agreement and went in front of the people.
And the Lord said to Joshua, From now on I will give you glory in the eyes of all Israel, so that they may see that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
And you are to give orders to the priests who take up the ark of the agreement, and say, When you come to the edge of the waters of Jordan, go no further.
And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come to me here: and give ear to the words of the Lord your God.
And Joshua said, By this you will see that the living God is among you, and that he will certainly send out from before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.
See, the ark of the agreement of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into Jordan.
So take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, a man from every tribe.
And when the feet of the priests who take up the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of Jordan, the waters of Jordan will be cut off, all the waters flowing down from higher up, and will come together in a mass.
So when the people went out from their tents to go over Jordan, the priests who took up the ark of the agreement were in front of the people;
And when those who took up the ark came to Jordan, and the feet of the priests who took up the ark were touching the edge of the water (for the waters of Jordan are overflowing all through the time of the grain-cutting),
Then the waters flowing down from higher up were stopped and came together in a mass a long way back at Adam, a town near Zarethan; and the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were cut off: and the people went across opposite Jericho.
And the priests who took up the ark of the agreement of the Lord kept their places, with their feet on dry land in the middle of Jordan, while all Israel went over on dry land, till all the nation had gone over Jordan.
For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house, who went out early in the morning to get workers into his vine-garden.
And when he had made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day, he sent them into his vine-garden.
And he went out about the third hour, and saw others in the market-place doing nothing;
And he said to them, Go into the vine-garden with the others, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went to work.
Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same.
And about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing; and he says to them, Why are you here all the day doing nothing?
They say to him, Because no man has given us work. He says to them, Go in with the rest, into the vine-garden.
And when evening came, the lord of the vine-garden said to his manager, Let the workers come, and give them their payment, from the last to the first.
And when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour, they were given every man a penny.
Then those who came first had the idea that they would get more; and they, like the rest, were given a penny.
And when they got it, they made a protest against the master of the house,
Saying, These last have done only one hour's work, and you have made them equal to us, who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat.
But he in answer said to one of them, Friend, I do you no wrong: did you not make an agreement with me for a penny?
Take what is yours, and go away; it is my pleasure to give to this last, even as to you.
Have I not the right to do as seems good to me in my house? or is your eye evil, because I am good?
So the last will be first, and the first last.
And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples on one side, and said to them,
See, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes; and they will give orders for him to be put to death,
And will give him up to the Gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross: and the third day he will come back again from the dead.
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, giving him worship and making a request of him.
And he said to her, What is your desire? She says to him, Let my two sons be seated, the one at your right hand, and the other at your left, in your kingdom.
But Jesus made answer and said, You have no idea what you are requesting. Are you able to take of the cup which I am about to take?
They say to him, We are able. He says to them, Truly, you will take of my cup: but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give, but it is for those for whom my Father has made it ready.
And when it came to the ears of the ten, they were angry with the two brothers.
But Jesus said to them, You see that the rulers of the Gentiles are lords over them, and their great ones have authority over them.
Let it not be so among you: but if anyone has a desire to become great among you, let him be your servant;
And whoever has a desire to be first among you, let him take the lowest place:
Even as the Son of man did not come to have servants, but to be a servant, and to give his life for the salvation of men.
And when they were going out from Jericho, a great number went after him.
And two blind men seated by the wayside, when they had the news that Jesus was going by, gave a loud cry, saying, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.
And the people gave them orders to be quiet; but they went on crying even louder, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.
And Jesus, stopping, sent for them, and said, What would you have me do to you?
They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be open.
And Jesus, being moved with pity, put his fingers on their eyes: and straight away they were able to see, and went after him.
Let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers, because there is no power which is not of God, and all powers are ordered by God.
For which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of God: and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves.
For rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil. If you would have no fear of the authority, do good and you will have praise;
For he is the servant of God to you for good. But if you do evil, have fear; for the sword is not in his hand for nothing: he is God's servant, making God's punishment come on the evil-doer.
So put yourselves under the authority, not for fear of wrath, but because you have the knowledge of what is right.
For the same reason, make payment of taxes; because the authority is God's servant, to take care of such things at all times.
Give to all what is their right: taxes to him whose they are, payment to him whose right it is, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour is to be given.
Be in debt for nothing, but to have love for one another: for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law.
And this, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not put to death, Do not take what is another's, Do not have desire for what is another's, and if there is any other order, it is covered by this word, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.
Love does no wrong to his neighbour, so love makes the law complete.
See then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep: for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith.
The night is far gone, and the day is near: so let us put off the works of the dark, arming ourselves with light,
With right behaviour as in the day; not in pleasure-making and drinking, not in bad company and unclean behaviour, not in fighting and envy.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires.
Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had made to come back from the dead.
So they made him a meal there, and he was waited on by Martha, and Lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table.
Then Mary, taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value, put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair: and the house became full of the smell of the perfume.
But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was to give him up), said,
Why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence, and the money given to the poor?
(He said this, not because he had any love for the poor; but because he was a thief, and, having the money-bag, took for himself what was put into it.)
Then Jesus said, Let her be. Let her keep what she has for the day of my death.
The poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever.
Then a great number of the Jews had news that he was there: and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they might see Lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life.
Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death;
For because of him a great number of the Jews went away and had belief in Jesus.
The day after, a great number of people who were there for the feast, when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
Took branches of palm-trees and went out to him, crying, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!
And Jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it; as the Writings say,
Have no fear, daughter of Zion: see your King is coming, seated on a young ass.
(These things were not clear to his disciples at first: but when Jesus had been lifted up into his glory, then it came to their minds that these things in the Writings were about him and that they had been done to him.)
Now the people who were with him when his voice came to Lazarus in the place of the dead, and gave him life again, had been talking about it.
And that was the reason the people went out to him, because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign.
Then the Pharisees said one to another, You see, you are unable to do anything: the world has gone after him.
Now there were some Greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast:
They came to Philip, who was of Beth-saida in Galilee, and made a request, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus.
Philip went and gave word of it to Andrew; and Andrew went with Philip to Jesus.
And Jesus said to them in answer, The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come.
Truly I say to you, If a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end, it is still a seed and no more; but through its death it gives much fruit.
He who is in love with life will have it taken from him; and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever.
If any man is my servant, let him come after me; and where I am, there will my servant be. If any man becomes my servant, my Father will give him honour.
Now is my soul troubled; and what am I to say? Father, keep me from this hour. No: for this purpose have I come to this hour.
Father, give glory to your name. Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, I have given it glory, and I will give it glory again.
Hearing the sound, a number of people who were there said that it was thunder: others said, An angel was talking to him.
Jesus said in answer, This voice came not for me but for you.
Now is this world to be judged: now will the ruler of this world be sent out.
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will make all men come to me.
(This he said, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)
Then the people in answer said to him, The law says that the Christ will have life without end: how say you then that it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
Jesus said to them, For a little time longer the light will be among you; while you have the light go on walking in it, so that the dark may not overtake you: one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going.
In so far as you have the light, put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light. With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them.
But though he had done such a number of signs before them, they still had no belief in him:
So that the words of the prophet Isaiah might come true, when he said, Lord, who has any belief in our preaching? and the arm of the Lord, to whom has it been unveiled?
For this reason they were unable to have belief, because Isaiah said again,
He has made their eyes blind, and their hearts hard; for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts, and be changed, and I might make them well.
(Isaiah said these words because he saw his glory. His words were about him.)
However, a number even of the rulers had belief in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the Synagogue:
For the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of God.
Then Jesus said with a loud voice, He who has faith in me, has faith not in me, but in him who sent me.
And he who sees me, sees him who sent me.
I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark.
And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them, I am not his judge: I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world.
He who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart, is not without a judge: the word which I have said will be his judge on the last day.
For I have not said it on my authority, but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it.
And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life: so that the things which I say, I say them even as the Father says them to me.
A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, you have been our resting-place in all generations.
Before the mountains were made, before you had given birth to the earth and the world, before time was, and for ever, you are God.
You send man back to his dust; and say, Go back, you children of men.
For to you a thousand years are no more than yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night.
...
In the morning it is green; in the evening it is cut down, and becomes dry.
We are burned up by the heat of your passion, and troubled by your wrath.
You have put our evil doings before you, our secret sins in the light of your face.
For all our days have gone by in your wrath; our years come to an end like a breath.
The measure of our life is seventy years; and if through strength it may be eighty years, its pride is only trouble and sorrow, for it comes to an end and we are quickly gone.
Who has knowledge of the power of your wrath, or who takes note of the weight of your passion?
So give us knowledge of the number of our days, that we may get a heart of wisdom.
Come back, O Lord; how long? let your purpose for your servants be changed.
In the morning give us your mercy in full measure; so that we may have joy and delight all our days.
Make us glad in reward for the days of our sorrow, and for the years in which we have seen evil.
Make your work clear to your servants, and your glory to their children.
Let the pleasure of the Lord our God be on us: O Lord, give strength to the work of our hands.
Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had by Jacob, went out to see the women of that country.
And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite who was the chief of that land, saw her, he took her by force and had connection with her.
Then his heart went out in love to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he said comforting words to her.
And Shechem said to Hamor, his father, Get me this girl for my wife.
Now Jacob had word of what Shechem had done to his daughter; but his sons were in the fields with the cattle, and Jacob said nothing till they came.
Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, came out to have a talk with Jacob.
Now the sons of Jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it, and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in Israel by having connection with Jacob's daughter; and they said, Such a thing is not to be done.
But Hamor said to them, Shechem, my son, is full of desire for your daughter: will you then give her to him for a wife?
And let our two peoples be joined together; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
Go on living with us, and the country will be open to you; do trade and get property there.
And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, If you will give ear to my request, whatever you say I will give to you.
However great you make the bride-price and payment, I will give it; only let me have the girl for my wife.
But the sons of Jacob gave a false answer to Shechem and Hamor his father, because of what had been done to Dinah their sister.
And they said, It is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision, for that would be a cause of shame to us:
But on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you: if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision;
Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people.
But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go.
And their words were pleasing to Hamor and his son Shechem.
And without loss of time the young man did as they said, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was the noblest of his father's house.
Then Hamor and Shechem, his son, went to the meeting-place of their town, and said to the men of the town,
It is the desire of these men to be at peace with us; let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here, for the country is wide open before them; let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters.
But these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people, only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done.
Then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us.
Then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of Hamor and Shechem his son; and every male in the town underwent circumcision.
But on the third day after, before the wounds were well, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death.
And Hamor and his son they put to death with the sword, and they took Dinah from Shechem's house and went away.
And the sons of Jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister;
They took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields,
And all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives; everything in their houses they took and made them waste.
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me; and it will be the end of me and all my people.
But they said, Were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman?
The word of the Lord which came to Micah the Morashtite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah: his vision about Samaria and Jerusalem.
Give ear, you peoples, all of you; give attention, O earth and everything in it: let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy Temple.
For see, the Lord is coming out from his place, and will come down, stepping on the high places of the earth.
And the mountains will be turned to water under him, and the deep valleys will be broken open, like wax before the fire, like waters flowing down a slope.
All this is because of the wrongdoing of Jacob and the sins of the children of Israel. What is the wrongdoing of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
So I will make Samaria into a field and the plantings of a vine-garden: I will send its stones falling down into the valley, uncovering its bases.
And all her pictured images will be hammered into bits, and all the payments for her loose ways will be burned with fire, and all the images of her gods I will make waste: for with the price of a loose woman she got them together, and as the price of a loose woman will they be given back.
For this I will be full of sorrow and give cries of grief; I will go uncovered and unclothed: I will give cries of grief like the jackals and will be in sorrow like the ostriches.
For her wounds may not be made well: for it has come even to Judah, stretching up to the doorway of my people, even to Jerusalem.
Give no word of it in Gath, let there be no weeping at all: at Beth-le-aphrah be rolling in the dust.
Be uncovered and go away, you who are living in Shaphir: the one living in Zaanan has not come out of her town; Beth-ezel is taken away from its base, even from its resting-place.
For the one living in Maroth is waiting for good: for evil has come down from the Lord to the doorways of Jerusalem.
Let the war-carriage be yoked to the quick-running horse, you who are living in Lachish: she was the first cause of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the wrongdoings of Israel were seen in you.
For this cause give a parting offering to Moresheth-gath: the daughter of Achzib will be a deceit to the king of Israel.
Even now will the taker of your heritage come to you, you who are living in Mareshah: the glory of Israel will come to destruction for ever.
Let your head be uncovered and your hair cut off in sorrow for the children of your delight: let the hair be pulled from your head like an eagle's; for they have been taken away from you as prisoners.
Now news came to Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, of all God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, and how the Lord had taken Israel out of Egypt.
And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,
And her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom, for he said, I have been living in a strange land:
And the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, The God of my father was my help, and kept me safe from the sword of Pharaoh:
And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to where Moses had put up his tent in the waste land, by the mountain of God.
And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law, have come to you, with your wife and your two sons.
And Moses went out to his father-in-law, and went down on his face before him and gave him a kiss; and they said to one another, Are you well? and they came into the tent.
And Moses gave his father-in-law an account of all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians because of Israel, and of all the troubles which had come on them by the way, and how the Lord had given them salvation.
And Jethro was glad because the Lord had been good to Israel, freeing them from the power of the Egyptians.
And Jethro said, Praise be to the Lord, who has taken you out of the hand of Pharaoh and out of the hand of the Egyptians; freeing the people from the yoke of the Egyptians.
Now I am certain that the Lord is greater than all gods, for he has overcome them in their pride.
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, made a burned offering to God: and Aaron came, with the chiefs of Israel, and had a meal with Moses' father-in-law, before God.
Now on the day after, Moses took his seat to give decisions for the people: and the people were waiting before Moses from morning till evening.
And when Moses' father-in-law saw all he was doing, he said, What is this you are doing for the people? why are you seated here by yourself, with all the people waiting before you from morning till evening?
And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to get directions from God:
And if they have any question between themselves, they come to me, and I am judge between a man and his neighbour, and I give them the orders and laws of God.
And Moses' father-in-law said to him, What you are doing is not good.
Your strength and that of the people will be completely used up: this work is more than you are able to do by yourself.
Give ear now to my suggestion, and may God be with you: you are to be the people's representative before God, taking their causes to him:
Teaching them his rules and his laws, guiding them in the way they have to go, and making clear to them the work they have to do.
But for the rest, take from among the people able men, such as have the fear of God, true men hating profits wrongly made; and put such men over them, to be captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens;
And let them be judges in the causes of the people at all times: and let them put before you all important questions, but in small things let them give decisions themselves: in this way, it will be less hard for you, and they will take the weight off you.
If you do this, and God gives approval, then you will be able to go on without weariness, and all this people will go to their tents in peace.
So Moses took note of the words of his father-in-law, and did as he had said.
And he made selection of able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens.
And they were judges in the causes of the people at all times: the hard questions they put before Moses; but on every small point they gave decisions themselves.
And Moses let his father-in-law go away, and he went back to his land.
And Job said in answer to the Lord,
I see that you are able to do every thing, and to give effect to all your designs.
Who is this who makes dark the purpose of God by words without knowledge? For I have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out.
Give ear to me, and I will say what is in my mind; I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.
Word of you had come to my ears, but now my eye has seen you.
For this cause I give witness that what I said is false, and in sorrow I take my seat in the dust.
And it came about, after he had said these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, I am very angry with you and your two friends, because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has.
And now, take seven oxen and seven sheep, and go to my servant Job, and give a burned offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will make prayer for you, that I may not send punishment on you; because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has.
And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the Lord had said. And the Lord gave ear to Job.
And the Lord made up to Job for all his losses, after he had made prayer for his friends: and all Job had before was increased by the Lord twice as much.
And all his brothers and sisters, and his friends of earlier days, came and took food with him in his house; and made clear their grief for him, and gave him comfort for all the evil which the Lord had sent on him; and they all gave him a bit of money and a gold ring.
And the Lord's blessing was greater on the end of Job's life than on its start: and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats, and six thousand camels, and two thousand oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
And he had seven sons and three daughters.
And he gave the first the name of Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch;
And there were no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job in all the earth: and their father gave them a heritage among their brothers.
And after this Job had a hundred and forty years of life, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
And Job came to his end, old and full of days.
And the spirit of God came on Azariah, the son of Oded;
And he came face to face with Asa and said to him, Give ear to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin: the Lord is with you while you are with him; if your heart's desire is for him, he will be near you, but if you give him up, he will give you up.
Now for a long time Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without the law;
But when in their trouble they were turned to the Lord, the God of Israel, searching after him, he let their search be rewarded.
In those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in, but great trouble was on all the people of the lands.
And they were broken by divisions, nation against nation and town against town, because God sent all sorts of trouble on them.
But be you strong and let not your hands be feeble, for your work will be rewarded.
And Asa, hearing these words of Azariah, the son of Oded the prophet, took heart and put away all the disgusting things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the towns which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he made new again the altar of the Lord in front of the covered way of the Lord's house.
And he got together all Judah and Benjamin and those of Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon who were living with them; for numbers of them came to him out of Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
So they came together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the rule of Asa.
And that day they made offerings to the Lord of the things they had taken in war, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
And they made an agreement to be true to the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and all their soul;
And that anyone, small or great, man or woman, who was not true to the Lord, the God of Israel, would be put to death.
And they made an oath to the Lord, with a loud voice, sounding wind-instruments and horns.
And all Judah was glad because of the oath, for they had taken it with all their heart, turning to the Lord with all their desire; and he was with them and gave them rest on every side.
And Asa would not let Maacah, his mother, be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah; and Asa had her image cut down and broken up and burned by the stream Kidron.
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life.
He took into the house of God all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy, silver and gold and vessels.
And there was no more war till the thirty-fifth year of the rule of Asa.
The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa; what he saw about Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earth-shock.
And he said, The Lord will give a lion's cry from Zion, his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem; and the fields of the keepers of sheep will become dry, and the top of Carmel will be wasted away.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they have been crushing Gilead with iron grain-crushing instruments.
And I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, burning up the great houses of Ben-hadad.
And I will have the locks of the door of Damascus broken, and him who is seated in power cut off from the valley of Aven, and him in whose hand is the rod from the house of Eden; and the people of Aram will go away as prisoners into Kir, says the Lord.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they took all the people away prisoners, to give them up to Edom.
And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, burning up its great houses:
Him who is seated in power I will have cut off from Ashdod, and him in whose hand is the rod from Ashkelon; and my hand will be turned against Ekron, and the rest of the Philistines will come to destruction, says the Lord God.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they gave up all the people prisoners to Edom, without giving a thought to the brothers' agreement between them.
And I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, burning up its great houses.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Edom, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because his sword was turned against his brother, without pity, and his wrath was burning at all times, and he was angry for ever.
And I will send a fire on Teman, burning up the great houses of Bozrah.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because in Gilead they had women with child cut open, so that they might make wider the limits of their land.
And I will make a fire in the wall of Rabbah, burning up its great houses, with loud cries in the days of war, with a storm in the day of the great wind:
And their king will be made prisoner, he and his captains together, says the Lord.
Then looking, I saw that on the arch which was over the head of the winged ones there was seen over them what seemed like a sapphire stone, having the form of a king's seat.
And he said to the man clothed in linen, Go in between the wheels, under the winged ones, and get your two hands full of burning coals from between the winged ones and send them in a shower over the town. And he went in before my eyes.
Now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the inner square was full of the cloud.
And the glory of the Lord went up from the winged ones and came to rest over the doorstep of the house; and the house was full of the cloud and the open square was full of the shining of the Lord's glory.
And the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square, like the voice of the Ruler of all.
And when he gave orders to the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the winged ones, then he went in and took his place at the side of a wheel.
And stretching out his hand to the fire which was between the winged ones, he took some of it and went out.
And I saw the form of a man's hands among the winged ones under their wings.
And looking, I saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones, one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another: and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye.
In form the four of them were all the same, they seemed like a wheel inside a wheel.
When they were moving, they went on their four sides without turning; they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking; they went without turning.
And the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about.
As for the wheels, they were named in my hearing, the circling wheels.
And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a winged one, and the second was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
And the winged ones went up on high: this is the living being which I saw by the river Chebar.
And when the winged ones went, the wheels went by their side: and when their wings were lifted to take them up from the earth, the wheels were not turned from their side.
When they were at rest in their place, these were at rest; when they were lifted up, these went up with them: for the spirit of life was in them.
Then the glory of the Lord went out from the doorstep of the house, and came to rest over the winged ones.
And the winged ones, lifting up their wings, went up from the earth before my eyes, with the wheels by their side: and they came to rest at the east doorway of the Lord's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high.
This is the living being which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and it was clear to me that they were the winged ones.
Every one had four faces and every one had four wings; and hands like a man's hands were under their wings.
As for the form of their faces, they were the faces whose form I saw by the river Chebar; when they went, every one of them went straight forward.
Now it came about after this that death came to Nahash, the king of the children of Ammon, and his son became king in his place.
And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, because his father was a friend to me. So David sent men to him, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And the servants of David came to Hanun, to the land of the children of Ammon, offering him comfort.
But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father, by sending comforters to you? is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so that they may overcome it?
So Hanun took David's servants, and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle, sent them away.
Then certain men went and gave David word of what had been done to them. And he sent out with the purpose of meeting them; for the men were greatly shamed. And the king said, Keep where you are at Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.
And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war-carriages and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.
So with this money they got thirty-two thousand war-carriages, and the help of the king of Maacah and his people, who came and took up their position in front of Medeba. And the children of Ammon came together from their towns for the fight.
And David, hearing of it, sent Joab with all the army of fighting-men.
So the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position on the way into the town; and the kings who had come were stationed by themselves in the field.
Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took all the best men of Israel, and put them in line against the Aramaeans;
And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon with Abishai, his brother, at their head.
And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then come to my help; and if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help.
Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God; and may the Lord do what seems good to him.
So Joab and the people who were with him went forward into the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him.
And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, his brother, and came into the town. Then Joab came back to Jerusalem.
And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they sent men to get the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River, with Shophach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.
And word of this was given to David; and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam and put his forces in position against them. And when David's forces were in position against the Aramaeans, the fight was started.
And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven thousand Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and put to death Shophach, the captain of the army.
And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants: and the Aramaeans would give no more help to the children of Ammon.
Now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him, and to have knowledge of the word of God, he was by a wide stretch of water named Gennesaret;
And he saw two boats by the edge of the water, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
And he got into one of the boats, the property of Simon, and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land. And being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat.
And when his talk was ended, he said to Simon, Go out into deep water, and let down your nets for fish.
And Simon, answering, said, Master, we were working all night and we took nothing: but at your word I will let down the nets.
And when they had done this, they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken;
And they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help. And they came, and the two boats were so full that they were going down.
But Simon, when he saw it, went down at the knees of Jesus and said, Go away from me, O Lord, for I am a sinner.
For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him, at the number of fish which they had taken;
And so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were working with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Have no fear; from this time forward you will be a fisher of men.
And when they had got their boats to the land, they gave up everything and went after him.
And it came about that while he was in one of the towns, there was a leper there: and when he saw Jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him, saying, Lord, if it is your pleasure, you have power to make me clean.
And he put out his hand to him and said, It is my pleasure; be clean. And straight away his disease went from him.
And he gave him orders: Say nothing to any man, but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean, as the law of Moses says, and for a witness to them.
But news of him went out all the more, in every direction, and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases.
But he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer.
And it came about that on one of these days he was teaching; and some Pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there, who had come from every town of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him, to make those who were ill free from their diseases.
And some men had with them, on a bed, a man who was ill, without power of moving; and they made attempts to get him in and put him before Jesus.
And because of the mass of people, there was no way to get him in; so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof, on his bed, into the middle in front of Jesus.
And seeing their faith he said, Man, you have forgiveness for your sins.
And the scribes and Pharisees were having an argument, saying, Who is this, who has no respect for God? who is able to give forgiveness for sins, but God only?
But Jesus, who had knowledge of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
Which is the simpler: to say, You have forgiveness for your sins; or to say, Get up and go?
But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins, (he said to the man who was ill,) I say to you, Get up, and take up your bed, and go into your house.
And straight away he got up before them, and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to God.
And wonder overcame them all, and they gave glory to God; and they were full of fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.
And after these things he went out, and saw Levi, a tax-farmer, seated at the place where taxes were taken, and said to him, Come after me.
And giving up his business, he got up and went after him.
And Levi made a great feast for him in his house: and a great number of tax-farmers and others were seated at table with them.
And the Pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples, saying, Why do you take food and drink with tax-farmers and sinners?
And Jesus, answering, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill.
I have come, not to get the upright, but sinners, so that they may be turned from their sins.
And they said to him, The disciples of John frequently go without food, and make prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees; but your disciples take food and drink.
And Jesus said, Are you able to make the friends of the newly-married man go without food when he is with them?
But the days will come when he will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food.
And he said to them, in a story, No man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat, for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old.
And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins, for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine, and the wine be let out, and the skins come to destruction.
But new wine has to be put into new wine-skins.
And no man, having had old wine, has any desire for new, for he says, The old is better.
By a soft answer wrath is turned away, but a bitter word is a cause of angry feelings.
Knowledge is dropping from the tongue of the wise; but from the mouth of the foolish comes a stream of foolish words.
The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.
A comforting tongue is a tree of life, but a twisted tongue is a crushing of the spirit.
A foolish man puts no value on his father's training; but he who has respect for teaching has good sense.
In the house of the upright man there is a great store of wealth; but in the profits of the sinner there is trouble.
The lips of the wise keep knowledge, but the heart of the foolish man is not right.
The offering of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright man is his delight.
The way of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but he who goes after righteousness is dear to him.
There is bitter punishment for him who is turned from the way; and death will be the fate of the hater of teaching.
Before the Lord are the underworld and destruction: how much more, then, the hearts of the children of men!
The hater of authority has no love for teaching: he will not go to the wise.
A glad heart makes a shining face, but by the sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.
The heart of the man of good sense goes in search of knowledge, but foolish things are the food of the unwise.
All the days of the troubled are evil; but he whose heart is glad has an unending feast.
Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great wealth together with trouble.
Better is a simple meal where love is, than a fat ox and hate with it.
An angry man makes men come to blows, but he who is slow to get angry puts an end to fighting.
Thorns are round the way of the hater of work; but the road of the hard worker becomes a highway.
A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man has no respect for his mother.
Foolish behaviour is joy to the unwise; but a man of good sense makes his way straight.
Where there are no wise suggestions, purposes come to nothing; but by a number of wise guides they are made certain.
A man has joy in the answer of his mouth: and a word at the right time, how good it is!
Acting wisely is the way of life, guiding a man away from the underworld.
The house of the man of pride will be uprooted by the Lord, but he will make safe the heritage of the widow.
Evil designs are disgusting to the Lord, but the words of the clean-hearted are pleasing.
He whose desires are fixed on profit is a cause of trouble to his family; but he who has no desire for offerings will have life.
The heart of the upright gives thought to his answer; but from the mouth of the evil-doer comes a stream of evil things.
The Lord is far from sinners, but his ear is open to the prayer of the upright.
The light of the eyes is a joy to the heart, and good news makes the bones fat.
The man whose ear is open to the teaching of life will have his place among the wise.
He who will not be controlled by training has no respect for his soul, but he who gives ear to teaching will get wisdom.
The fear of the Lord is the teaching of wisdom; and a low opinion of oneself goes before honour.
See my servant, whom I am supporting, my loved one, in whom I take delight: I have put my spirit on him; he will give the knowledge of the true God to the nations.
He will make no cry, his voice will not be loud: his words will not come to men's ears in the streets.
He will not let a crushed stem be quite broken, and he will not let a feebly burning light be put out: he will go on sending out the true word to the peoples.
His light will not be put out, and he will not be crushed, till he has given the knowledge of the true God to the earth, and the sea-lands will be waiting for his teaching.
God the Lord, even he who made the heavens, measuring them out on high; stretching out the earth, and giving its produce; he who gives breath to the people on it, and life to those who go about on it, says:
I the Lord have made you the vessel of my purpose, I have taken you by the hand, and kept you safe, and I have given you to be an agreement to the people, and a light to the nations:
To give eyes to the blind, to make free the prisoners from the prison, to let out those who are shut up in the dark.
I am the Lord; that is my name: I will not give my glory to another, or my praise to pictured images.
See, the things said before have come about, and now I give word of new things: before they come I give you news of them.
Make a new song to the Lord, and let his praise be sounded from the end of the earth; you who go down to the sea, and everything in it, the sea-lands and their people.
Let the waste land and its flocks be glad, the tent-circles of Kedar; let the people of the rock give a glad cry, from the top of the mountains let them make a sound of joy.
Let them give glory to the Lord, sounding his praise in the sea-lands.
The Lord will go out as a man of war, he will be moved to wrath like a fighting-man: his voice will be strong, he will give a loud cry; he will go against his attackers like a man of war.
I have long been quiet, I have kept myself in and done nothing: now I will make sounds of pain like a woman in childbirth, breathing hard and quickly.
I will make waste mountains and hills, drying up all their plants; and I will make rivers dry, and pools dry land.
And I will take the blind by a way of which they had no knowledge, guiding them by roads strange to them: I will make the dark places light before them, and the rough places level. These things will I do and will not give them up.
They will be turned back and be greatly shamed who put their hope in pictured images, who say to metal images, You are our gods.
Give ear, you whose ears are shut; and let your eyes be open, you blind, so that you may see.
Who is blind, but my servant? who has his ears stopped, but he whom I send? who is blind as my true one, or who has his ears shut like the Lord's servant?
Seeing much, but keeping nothing in mind; his ears are open, but there is no hearing.
It was the Lord's pleasure, because of his righteousness, to make the teaching great and give it honour.
But this is a people whose property has been taken away from them by force; they are all taken in holes, and shut up in prisons: they are made prisoners, and no one makes them free; they are taken by force and no one says, Give them back.
Who is there among you who will give ear to this? who will give attention to it for the time to come?
Who gave up Jacob to those who took away his goods, and Israel to his attackers? Did not the Lord? he against whom they did wrong, and in whose ways they would not go, turning away from his teaching.
For this reason he let loose on him the heat of his wrath, and his strength was like a flame; and it put fire round about him, but he did not see it; he was burned, but did not take it to heart.
Now Hiram, king of Tyre, hearing that Solomon had been made king in place of his father, sent his servants to him; for Hiram had ever been a friend to David.
And Solomon sent back word to Hiram, saying,
You have knowledge that David my father was not able to make a house for the name of the Lord his God, because of the wars which were round him on every side, till the Lord put all those who were against him under his feet.
But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; no one is making trouble, and no evil is taking place.
And so it is my purpose to make a house for the name of the Lord my God, as he said to David my father, Your son, whom I will make king in your place, will be the builder of a house for my name.
So now, will you have cedar-trees from Lebanon cut down for me, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you payment for your servants at whatever rate you say; for it is common knowledge that we have no such wood-cutters among us as the men of Zidon.
And these words of Solomon made Hiram glad, and he said, Now may the Lord be praised who has given to David a wise son to be king over this great people.
Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying; The words you sent have been given to me: I will do all your desire in the question of cedar-wood and cypress-wood.
My men will take them down from Lebanon to the sea, where I will have them corded together to go by sea to whatever place you say, and I will have them cut up there so that you may take them away; as for payment, it will be enough if you give me food for my people.
So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar-wood and cypress-wood he had need of;
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of grain, as food for his people, and twenty measures of clear oil; this he did every year.
Now the Lord had given Solomon wisdom, as he had said to him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made an agreement together.
Then King Solomon got together men for the forced work through all Israel, thirty thousand men in number;
And sent them to Lebanon in bands of ten thousand every month: for a month they were working in Lebanon and for two months in their country, and Adoniram was in control of them.
Then he had seventy thousand for the work of transport, and eighty thousand stone-cutters in the mountains;
In addition to the chiefs of the responsible men put by Solomon to oversee the work, three thousand and three hundred in authority over the workmen.
By the king's orders great stones, stones of high price, were cut out, so that the base of the house might be made of squared stone.
Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did the work of cutting them, and put edges on them, and got the wood and the stone ready for the building of the house.
Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite of the hill-country of Ephraim, named Elkanah; he was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
And he had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah: and Peninnah was the mother of children, but Hannah had no children.
Now this man went up from his town every year to give worship and to make offerings to the Lord of armies in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.
And when the day came for Elkanah to make his offering, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, their part of the feast:
But to Hannah he gave one part, though Hannah was very dear to him, but the Lord had not let her have children.
And the other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy, because the Lord had not let her have children;
And year by year, whenever she went up to the house of the Lord, she kept on attacking her, so that Hannah gave herself up to weeping and would take no food.
Then her husband Elkanah said to her, Hannah, why are you weeping? and why are you taking no food? why is your heart troubled? am I not more to you than ten sons?
So after they had taken food and wine in the guest room, Hannah got up. Now Eli the priest was seated by the pillars of the doorway of the Temple of the Lord.
And with grief in her soul, weeping bitterly, she made her prayer to the Lord.
And she made an oath, and said, O Lord of armies, if you will truly take note of the sorrow of your servant, not turning away from me but keeping me in mind, and will give me a man-child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and his hair will never be cut.
Now while she was a long time in prayer before the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.
For Hannah's prayer came from her heart, and though her lips were moving she made no sound: so it seemed to Eli that she was overcome with wine.
And Eli said to her, How long are you going to be the worse for drink? Put away the effects of your wine from you.
And Hannah, answering him, said, No, my lord, I am a woman whose spirit is broken with sorrow: I have not taken wine or strong drink, but I have been opening my heart before the Lord.
Do not take your servant to be a good-for-nothing woman: for my words have come from my stored-up sorrow and pain.
Then Eli said to her, Go in peace: and may the God of Israel give you an answer to the prayer you have made to him.
And she said, May your servant have grace in your eyes. So the woman went away, and took part in the feast, and her face was no longer sad.
And early in the morning they got up, and after worshipping before the Lord they went back to Ramah, to their house: and Elkanah had connection with his wife; and the Lord kept her in mind.
Now the time came when Hannah, being with child, gave birth to a son; and she gave him the name Samuel, Because, she said, I made a prayer to the Lord for him.
And the man Elkanah with all his family went up to make the year's offering to the Lord, and to give effect to his oath.
But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go till the child has been taken from the breast, and then I will take him with me and put him before the Lord, where he may be for ever.
And her husband Elkanah said to her, Do whatever seems right to you, but not till you have taken him from the breast; only may the Lord do as he has said. So the woman, waiting there, gave her son milk till he was old enough to be taken from the breast.
Then when she had done so, she took him with her, with a three-year old ox and an ephah of meal and a skin full of wine, and took him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh: now the child was still very young.
And when they had made an offering of the ox, they took the child to Eli.
And she said, O my lord, as your soul is living, my lord, I am that woman who was making a prayer to the Lord here by your side:
My prayer was for this child; and the Lord has given him to me in answer to my request:
So I have given him to the Lord; for all his life he is the Lord's. Then he gave the Lord worship there.
Give ear now to the words of the Lord: Up! put forward your cause before the mountains, let your voice be sounding among the hills.
Give ear, O you mountains, to the Lord's cause, and take note, you bases of the earth: for the Lord has a cause against his people, and he will take it up with Israel.
O my people, what have I done to you? how have I been a weariness to you? give answer against me.
For I took you up out of the land of Egypt and made you free from the prison-house; I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
O my people, keep in mind now what was designed by Balak, king of Moab, and the answer which Balaam, son of Beor, gave him; the events, from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may be certain of the upright acts of the Lord.
With what am I to come before the Lord and go with bent head before the high God? am I to come before him with burned offerings, with young oxen a year old?
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of sheep or with ten thousand rivers of oil? am I to give my first child for my wrongdoing, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
He has made clear to you, O man, what is good; and what is desired from you by the Lord; only doing what is right, and loving mercy, and walking without pride before your God.
The voice of the Lord is crying out to the town: Give ear, you tribes and the meeting of the town.
Am I to let the stores of the evil-doer go out of my memory, and the short measure, which is cursed?
Is it possible for me to let wrong scales and the bag of false weights go without punishment?
For its men of wealth are cruel, and its people have said what is not true, and their tongue is false in their mouth.
So I have made a start with your punishment; I have made you waste because of your sins.
You will have food, but not enough; your shame will be ever with you: you will get your goods moved, but you will not take them away safely; and what you do take away I will give to the sword.
You will put in seed, but you will not get in the grain; you will be crushing olives, but your bodies will not be rubbed with the oil; and you will get in the grapes, but you will have no wine.
For you have kept the laws of Omri and all the works of the family of Ahab, and you have been guided by their designs: so that I might make you a cause of wonder and your people a cause of hisses; and the shame of my people will be on you.
To the chief music-maker; put to Al-tashheth. A Psalm. Of Asaph. A Song. To you, O God, we give praise, to you we give praise: and those who give honour to your name make clear your works of power.
When the right time has come, I will be the judge in righteousness.
When the earth and all its people become feeble, I am the support of its pillars. (Selah.)
I say to the men of pride, Let your pride be gone: and to the sinners, Let not your horn be lifted up.
Let not your horn be lifted up: let no more words of pride come from your outstretched necks.
For honour does not come from the east, or from the west, or uplifting from the south;
But God is the judge, putting down one, and lifting up another.
For in the hand of the Lord is a cup, and the wine is red; it is well mixed, overflowing from his hand: he will make all the sinners of the earth take of it, even to the last drop.
But I will ever be full of joy, making songs of praise to the God of Jacob.
By him will all the horns of the sinners be cut off; but the horns of the upright will be lifted up.
And he took me out into the inner square in the direction of the north: and he took me into the rooms which were opposite the separate place and opposite the building to the north.
On the north side it was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide,
Opposite the space of twenty cubits which was part of the inner square, and opposite the stone floor of the outer square. There were covered ways facing one another on the third floor.
And in front of the rooms was a walk, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long; and their doors were facing north.
And the higher rooms were shorter: for the covered ways took up more space from these than from the lower and middle rooms.
For they were on three floors, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the outer square; so the highest was narrower than the lowest and middle floors from the earth level.
And the wall which went outside by the side of the rooms, in the direction of the outer square in front of the rooms, was fifty cubits long.
For the rooms in the outer square were fifty cubits long: and in front of the Temple was a space of a hundred cubits.
And under these rooms was the way in from the east side, as one goes into them from the outer square at the head of the outer wall.
(And he took me) to the south, and in front of the separate place and in front of the building there were rooms.
And there was a walk in front of them like that by the rooms on the north; they were equally long and wide; and the ways out of them were the same in design and had the same sort of doors.
And under the rooms on the south was a door at the head of the outer wall in the direction of the east as one goes in.
And he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms in front of the separate place are the holy rooms, where the priests who come near the Lord take the most holy things for their food: there the most holy things are placed, with the meal offering and the sin-offering and the offering for error; for the place is holy.
When the priests go in, they may not go out of the holy place into the outer square, and there they are to put the robes in which they do the work of the Lord's house, for they are holy: and they have to put on other clothing before they come near that which has to do with the people.
And when he had come to the end of measuring the inner house, he took me out to the doorway looking to the east, and took its measure all round.
He went round and took the measure of it on the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round.
And he went round and took the measure of it on the north side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round.
And he went round and took the measure of it on the south side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round.
And he went round and took the measure of it on the west side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round.
He took its measure on the four sides: and it had a wall all round, five hundred long and five hundred wide, separating what was holy from what was common.
Then David had discussions with the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds and with every chief.
And David said to all the men of Israel who had come together there, If it seems good to you and if it is the purpose of the Lord our God, let us send to all the rest of our brothers, everywhere in the land of Israel, and to the priests and the Levites in their towns and the country round them, and get them to come together here to us;
And let us get back for ourselves the ark of our God: for in the days of Saul we did not go to it for directions.
And all the people said they would do so, for it seemed right to them.
So David sent for all Israel to come together, from Shihor, the river of Egypt, as far as the way into Hamath, to get the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
And David went up, with all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim in Judah, to get up from there the ark of God, over which the holy Name is named, the name of the Lord whose place is between the winged ones.
And they put the ark of God on a new cart, and took it out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio were the drivers of the cart.
Then David and all Israel made melody before God with all their strength, with songs and corded instruments of music, and with brass instruments and horns.
And when they came to the grain-floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to keep the ark in its place, for the oxen were slipping.
And the wrath of the Lord, burning against Uzza, sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark, and death came to him there before God.
And David was angry because of the Lord's outburst of wrath against Uzza, and he gave that place the name Perez-uzza, to this day.
And so great was David's fear of God that day, that he said, How may I let the ark of God come to me?
So David did not let the ark come back to him to the town of David, but had it turned away and put into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
And the ark of God was in the house of Obed-edom for three months; and the Lord sent a blessing on the house of Obed-edom and on all he had.
A Psalm. Of David. I will make a song of mercy and righteousness; to you, O Lord, will I make melody.
I will do wisely in the way of righteousness: O when will you come to me? I will be walking in my house with a true heart.
I will not put any evil thing before my eyes; I am against all turning to one side; I will not have it near me.
The false heart I will send away from me: I will not have an evil-doer for a friend.
I will put to death anyone who says evil of his neighbour secretly; the man with a high look and a heart of pride is disgusting to me.
My eyes will be on those of good faith in the land, so that they may be living in my house; he who is walking in the right way will be my servant.
The worker of deceit will not come into my house; the false man will have no place before my eyes.
Morning by morning will I put to death all the sinners in the land, so that all evil-doers may be cut off from Jerusalem.
And the Lord said to Moses in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho,
Give orders to the children of Israel to give to the Levites, from the heritage which is theirs, towns for themselves, with land on the outskirts of the towns.
These towns are to be their living-places, with land round them for their cattle and their food and all their beasts,
Stretching from the wall of the towns a distance of a thousand cubits all round.
The measure of this space of land is to be two thousand cubits outside the town on the east, and two thousand cubits on the south and on the west and on the north, the town being in the middle. This space will be the outskirts of their towns.
And the towns which you give the Levites are to be the six safe places to which the taker of life may go in flight; and in addition you are to give them forty-two towns.
Forty-eight towns are to be given to the Levites, all with land round them.
And these towns are to be given out of the heritage of the children of Israel, taking the greater number from those who have much, and a smaller number from those who have little: everyone, in the measure of his heritage, is to give of his property to the Levites.
And the Lord said to Moses,
Say to the children of Israel, when you have gone over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
Then let certain towns be marked out as safe places to which anyone who takes the life of another in error may go in flight.
In these towns you may be safe from him who has the right of punishment; so that death may not overtake the taker of life till he has been judged by the meeting of the people.
Six of the towns which you give will be such safe places;
Three on the other side of Jordan and three in the land of Canaan, to be safe places for flight.
For the children of Israel and for the man from another country who is living among them, these six towns are to be safe places, where anyone causing the death of another through error may go in flight.
But if a man gives another man a blow with an iron instrument, causing his death, he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death.
Or if he gives him a blow with a stone in his hand, causing his death, he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death.
Or if he gave him blows with a wood instrument in his hands, causing his death, he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death.
He whose right it is to give punishment for blood, may himself put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him.
If in his hate he put a sword through him, or waiting secretly for him sent a spear or stone at him, causing his death;
Or in hate gave him blows with his hand, causing death; he who gave the death-blow is to be put to death; he is a taker of life: he whose right it is to give punishment for blood may put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him.
But if a man has given a wound to another suddenly and not in hate, or without design has sent something against him,
Or has given him a blow with a stone, without seeing him, so causing his death, though he had nothing against him and no desire to do him evil:
Then let the meeting of the people be judge between the man responsible for the death and him who has the right of punishment for blood, acting by these rules:
And let the people keep the man responsible for the death safe from the hands of him who has the right of punishment for blood, and send him back to his safe town where he had gone in flight: there let him be till the death of the high priest who was marked with the holy oil.
But if ever he goes outside the walls of the safe town where he had gone in flight,
And the giver of punishment, meeting him outside the walls of the town, puts him to death, he will not be responsible for his blood:
Because he had been ordered to keep inside the safe town till the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the taker of life may come back to the place of his heritage.
These rules are to be your guide in judging through all your generations wherever you may be living.
Anyone causing the death of another is himself to be put to death on the word of witnesses: but the word of one witness is not enough.
Further, no price may be given for the life of one who has taken life and whose right reward is death: he is certainly to be put to death.
And no price may be offered for one who has gone in flight to a safe town, for the purpose of letting him come back to his place before the death of the high priest.
So do not make the land where you are living unholy: for blood makes the land unholy: and there is no way of making the land free from the blood which has come on it, but only by the death of him who was the cause of it.
Do not make unclean the land where you are living and in which is my House: for I the Lord am present among the children of Israel.
Let us be judged as servants of Christ, and as those who are responsible for the secret things of God.
And it is right for such servants to be safe persons.
But it is a small thing to me that I am judged by you or by man's judging; I am not even a judge of myself.
For I am not conscious of any wrong in myself; but this does not make me clear, for it is the Lord who is my judge.
For this reason let there be no judging before the time, till the Lord comes, who will make clear the secret things of the dark, and the designs of the heart; and then will every man have his praise from God.
My brothers, it is because of you that I have taken Apollos and myself as examples of these things, so that in us you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy Writings, so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brother.
For who made you better than your brother? or what have you that has not been given to you? but if it has been given to you, what cause have you for pride, as if it had not been given to you?
For even now you are full, even now you have wealth, you have been made kings without us: truly, I would be glad if you were kings, so that we might be kings with you.
For it seems to me that God has put us the Apostles last of all, as men whose fate is death: for we are put on view to the world, and to angels, and to men.
We are made to seem foolish for Christ, but you are wise in Christ; we are feeble, but you are strong; you have glory, but we have shame.
Even to this hour we are without food, drink, and clothing, we are given blows and have no certain resting-place;
And with our hands we do the hardest work: when they give us curses we give blessings, when we undergo punishment we take it quietly;
When evil things are said about us we give gentle answers: we are made as the unclean things of the world, as that for which no one has any use, even till now.
I am not saying these things to put you to shame, but so that, as my dear children, you may see what is right.
For even if you had ten thousand teachers in Christ, you have not more than one father: for in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news.
So my desire is that you take me as your example.
For this cause I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and true child in the Lord; he will make clear to you my ways in Christ, even as I am teaching everywhere in every church.
Now some are full of pride, as if I was not coming to you.
But I will come to you in a short time, if it is pleasing to the Lord, and I will take note, not of the word of those who are full of pride, but of the power.
For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.
What is your desire? is my coming to be with punishment, or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit?
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
Let this month be to you the first of months, the first month of the year.
Say to all the children of Israel when they are come together, In the tenth day of this month every man is to take a lamb, by the number of their fathers' families, a lamb for every family:
And if the lamb is more than enough for the family, let that family and its nearest neighbour have a lamb between them, taking into account the number of persons and how much food is needed for every man.
Let your lamb be without a mark, a male in its first year: you may take it from among the sheep or the goats:
Keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month, when everyone who is of the children of Israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark.
Then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken.
And let your food that night be the flesh of the lamb, cooked with fire in the oven, together with unleavened bread and bitter-tasting plants.
Do not take it uncooked or cooked with boiling water, but let it be cooked in the oven; its head with its legs and its inside parts.
Do not keep any of it till the morning; anything which is not used is to be burned with fire.
And take your meal dressed as if for a journey, with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands: take it quickly: it is the Lord's Passover.
For on that night I will go through the land of Egypt, sending death on every first male child, of man and of beast, and judging all the gods of Egypt: I am the Lord.
And the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are: when I see the blood I will go over you, and no evil will come on you for your destruction, when my hand is on the land of Egypt.
And this day is to be kept in your memories: you are to keep it as a feast to the Lord through all your generations, as an order for ever.
For seven days let your food be unleavened bread; from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses: whoever takes bread with leaven in it, from the first till the seventh day, will be cut off from Israel.
And on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting; no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyone's food.
So keep the feast of unleavened bread; for on this very day I have taken your armies out of the land of Egypt: this day, then, is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever.
In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day, let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.
For seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses: for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of Israel, if he is from another country or if he is an Israelite by birth.
Take nothing which has leaven in it; wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes.
Then Moses sent for the chiefs of Israel, and said to them, See that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families, and let the Passover lamb be put to death.
And take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin, touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin; and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning.
For the Lord will go through the land, sending death on the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door, the Lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction.
And you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever.
And when you come into the land which the Lord will make yours, as he gave his word, you are to keep this act of worship.
And when your children say to you, What is the reason of this act of worship?
Then you will say, This is the offering of the Lord's Passover; for he went over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he sent death on the Egyptians, and kept our families safe. And the people gave worship with bent heads.
And the children of Israel went and did so; as the Lord had given orders to Moses and Aaron, so they did.
And in the middle of the night the Lord sent death on every first male child in the land of Egypt, from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison; and the first births of all the cattle.
Then Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and a great cry went up from Egypt; for there was not a house where someone was not dead.
And he sent for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Get up and go out from among my people, you and the children of Israel; go and give worship to the Lord as you have said.
And take your flocks and your herds as you have said, and be gone; and give me your blessing.
And the Egyptians were forcing the people on, to get them out of the land quickly; for they said, We are all dead men.
And the people took their bread-paste before it was leavened, putting their basins in their clothing on their backs.
And the children of Israel had done as Moses had said; and they got from the Egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold, and clothing:
And the Lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested. So they took away all their goods from the Egyptians.
And the children of Israel made the journey from Rameses to Succoth; there were about six hundred thousand men on foot, as well as children.
And a mixed band of people went with them; and flocks and herds in great numbers.
And they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of Egypt; it was not leavened, for they had been sent out of Egypt so quickly, that they had no time to make any food ready.
Now the children of Israel had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years.
And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the armies of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt.
It is a watch-night before the Lord who took them out of the land of Egypt: this same night is a watch-night to the Lord for all the children of Israel, through all their generations.
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the Passover: no man who is not an Israelite is to take of it:
But every man's servant, whom he has got for money, may take of it, when he has had circumcision.
A man from a strange country living among you, and a servant working for payment, may not take part in it.
It is to be taken in one house; not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house, and no bone of it may be broken.
All Israel is to keep the feast.
And if a man from another country is living with you, and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all the males of his family undergo circumcision, and then let him come near and keep it; for he will then be as one of your people; but no one without circumcision may keep it.
The law is the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you.
So the children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses and Aaron.
And on that very day the Lord took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
Give ear, O Israel: today you are to go over Jordan, to take the heritage of nations greater and stronger than yourselves, and towns of great size with walls as high as heaven;
A people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, of whom you have knowledge and of whom it has been said, All are forced to give way before the sons of Anak.
Be certain then today that it is the Lord your God who goes over before you like an all-burning fire; he will send destruction on them, crushing them before you; and you will send them in flight, putting an end to them quickly, as the Lord has said.
And after the Lord has sent them in flight from before you, say not in your heart, Because of my righteousness the Lord has given me this land; when it is because of their evil-doing that the Lord is driving these nations out before you.
Not for your righteousness or because your hearts are upright are you going in to take their land; but because of the evil-doing of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out from before you, and to give effect to his oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Be certain then that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land as a reward for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.
Keep well in mind how you made the Lord your God angry in the waste land; from the day when you went out of Egypt till you came to this place, you have gone against the orders of the Lord.
Again in Horeb you made the Lord angry, and in his wrath he would have put an end to you.
When I had gone up into the mountain to be given the stones on which was recorded the agreement which the Lord made with you, I was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights without taking food or drinking water.
And the Lord gave me the two stones with writing on them done by the finger of God: on them were recorded all the words which the Lord said to you on the mountain out of the heart of the fire, on the day of the great meeting.
Then at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me those stones, the stones of the agreement.
And the Lord said to me, Get up now, and go down quickly from this place; for the people you have taken out of Egypt have given themselves over to evil; they have quickly been turned from the way in which I gave them orders to go; they have made themselves a metal image.
And then the Lord said to me, I have seen that this people is stiff-necked:
Let me send destruction on them till their very name is cut off; and I will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they.
So turning round I came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire; and the two stones of the agreement were in my hands.
And I saw that you had done evil against the Lord, and had made for yourselves a metal image of a young ox: you had quickly been turned from the way in which the Lord had given you orders to go.
And I let the stones go from my hands, and they were broken before your eyes.
And I went down on my face before the Lord, as at the first, for forty days and forty nights, without taking food or drinking water, because of all your sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and moving him to wrath.
For I was full of fear because of the wrath of the Lord which was burning against you, with your destruction in view. But again the Lord's ear was open to my prayer.
And the Lord, in his wrath, would have put Aaron to death: and I made prayer for Aaron at the same time.
And I took your sin, the image which you had made, and put it in the fire and had it hammered and crushed very small till it was only dust: and the dust I put in the stream flowing down from the mountain.
Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you made the Lord angry.
And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and take the land which I have given you; you went against the orders of the Lord your God, and had no faith in him, and would not give ear to his voice.
From the day when I first had knowledge of you, you have gone against the word of the Lord.
So I went down on my face in prayer before the Lord for forty days and forty nights as I did at first; because the Lord had said that he would put an end to you.
And I made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord God, do not send destruction on your people and your heritage, to whom, by your great power, you have given salvation, whom you have taken out of Egypt by the strength of your hand.
Keep in mind your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not looking at the hard heart of this people, or their evil-doing and their sin:
Or it may be said in the land from which you have taken them, Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land which he said he would give them, and because of his hate for them, he has taken them out to put them to death in the waste land.
But still they are your people and your heritage, whom you took out by your great power and by your stretched-out arm.
This is what the Lord God let me see: and I saw a basket of summer fruit.
And he said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then the Lord said to me, The end has come to my people Israel; never again will my eyes be shut to their sin.
And the songs of the king's house will be cries of pain in that day, says the Lord God: great will be the number of the dead bodies, and everywhere they will put them out without a word.
Give ear to this, you who are crushing the poor, and whose purpose is to put an end to those who are in need in the land,
Saying, When will the new moon be gone, so that we may do trade in grain? and the Sabbath, so that we may put out in the market the produce of our fields? making the measure small and the price great, and trading falsely with scales of deceit;
Getting the poor for silver, and him who is in need for the price of two shoes, and taking a price for the waste parts of the grain.
The Lord has taken an oath by the pride of Jacob, Truly I will ever keep in mind all their works.
Will not the land be shaking with fear because of this, and everyone in it have sorrow? and all of it will be overflowing like the River; and it will be troubled and go down again like the River of Egypt.
And it will come about in that day, says the Lord God, that I will make the sun go down in the middle of the day, and I will make the earth dark in daylight:
Your feasts will be turned into sorrow and all your melody into songs of grief; everyone will be clothed with haircloth, and the hair of every head will be cut; I will make the weeping like that for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.
See, the days are coming, says the Lord God, when I will send times of great need on the land, not need of food or desire for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord.
And they will go wandering from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, running here and there in search of the word of the Lord, and they will not get it.
In that day the fair virgins and the young men will be feeble from need of water.
Those who make their oaths by the sin of Samaria and say, By the life of your God, O Dan; and, By the living way of Beer-sheba; even they will go down, never again to be lifted up.
And Elihu made answer and said,
Give ear, you wise, to my words; and you who have knowledge, give attention to me;
For words are tested by the ear, as food is tasted by the mouth.
Let us make the decision for ourselves as to what is right; let us have the knowledge among ourselves of what is good.
For Job has said, I am upright, and it is God who has taken away my right;
Though I am right, still I am in pain; my wound may not be made well, though I have done no wrong.
What man is like Job, a man who freely makes sport of God,
And goes in the company of evil-doers, walking in the way of sinners?
For he has said, It is no profit to a man to take delight in God.
Now then, you wise, take note; you men of knowledge, give ear to me. Let it be far from God to do evil, and from the Ruler of all to do wrong.
For he gives to every man the reward of his work, and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways.
Truly, God does not do evil, and the Ruler of all is not a false judge.
Who put the earth into his care, or made him responsible for the world?
If he made his spirit come back to him, taking his breath into himself again,
All flesh would come to an end together, and man would go back to the dust.
If you are wise, take note of this; give ear to the voice of my words.
How may a hater of right be a ruler? and will you say that the upright Ruler of all is evil?
He who says to a king, You are an evil-doer; and to rulers, You are sinners;
Who has no respect for rulers, and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor, for they are all the work of his hands.
Suddenly they come to an end, even in the middle of the night: the blow comes on the men of wealth, and they are gone, and the strong are taken away without the hand of man.
For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps.
There is no dark place, and no thick cloud, in which the workers of evil may take cover.
For he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged.
He sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause, and puts others in their place.
For he has knowledge of their works, overturning them in the night, so that they are crushed.
The evil-doers are broken by his wrath, he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers.
Because they did not go after him, and took no note of his ways,
